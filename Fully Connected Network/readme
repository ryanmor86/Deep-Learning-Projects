# This is a detailed example of implementing a fully connected neural network in Tensorflow including two libraries in order to
keep the structure simple and clean.
MNIST fashion has been used with 60000 images of shape 28 x28 for this example
The purpose of each function has been explained in detail in order to simplify the understanding
