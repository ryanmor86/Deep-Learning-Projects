- This is a detailed example of implementing a fully connected neural network in Tensorflow including two libraries in order to
keep the structure simple and clean.
- MNIST fashion has been used with 60000 images of shape 28 x28 for this example.
- The purpose of each function has been explained in detail in order to simplify the understanding. 
- This folder includes two examples as per below:

EXAMPLE 1: in this example, we show how to implement a fully connected neural network in Tensorflow

Example 2: in this example, we show how to train a model, save the model and later re-load the trained model to use on another dataset.
